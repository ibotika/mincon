                            complex tooth movement through skeletal anchorage. This course will cover the biological foundations
                            and clinical applications of temporary anchorage devices in orthodontics. The different anatomical
                            placement sites and related biomechanics shall also be discussed to give practitioners an edge in the
                            treatment efficiency of cases.
